# Citibike

## Project Overview

This project focuses on examining Citi Bike's 2022 bike-sharing data in New York City to uncover distribution challenges affecting bike availability and to propose practical solutions. 
As the lead analyst, my role is to investigate how factors like rider behavior, station placement, and weather conditions influence bike access across the city.

- Key areas of analysis include:

- Identifying the most frequently used starting stations

- Uncovering seasonal patterns and shifts in demand

- Highlighting problem zones with either excess bikes or consistent shortages

- Creating clear, interactive visualizations to support strategic decision-making for the business team

## Data Sourcing
This project draws on publicly available data from the Citi Bike NYC System Data portal, focusing on monthly trip records from 2023. 
These datasets include key details such as trip durations, start and end stations, bike IDs, and rider types.

To enhance the depth of analysis, we also incorporated external data sources:

- Weather data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) was used to study how weather affects ridership.

- NYC Open Data provided additional context related to station geography and neighborhood demographics.

All datasets were cleaned and standardized to ensure consistency and compatibility during the analysis process.

## Analysis Criteria
- Descriptive Analysis: Evaluate trip data to uncover high-traffic starting stations and identify seasonal trends in ridership.

- Geospatial Mapping: Use geographic visualizations to locate imbalances in station distribution, including areas with frequent shortages or overcrowding.

- Route & Weather Exploration: Analyze common travel routes and assess how weather conditions influence overall bike usage and rider behavior.

## Visualization Criteria
Dashboard: An interactive Python dashboard will be created to display the findings. 
It will be organized into sections that highlight the variables influencing demand, 
including:
<ul><li>Most common starting locations

</li> <li>Seasonal demand fluctuations

</li> <li>Problems with station distribution

</li> <li>Popular bike routes</li></ul>
